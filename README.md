### Project Overview:

The global spread of viruses presents significant challenges to public health, underscoring the need for effective monitoring and control measures. Genomic surveillance, which involves the sequencing and analysis of viral genomes, is crucial for detecting new variants and guiding interventions. However, high costs and uneven resource distribution hinder its global implementation.

This project demonstrates that optimizing genomic surveillance by focusing on high-risk groups—specifically international travelers and major travel hubs—can significantly enhance the early detection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Utilizing a comprehensive metapopulation multiple-strain model calibrated with extensive data, we show that reallocating existing resources towards these key areas reduces detection times without additional costs. This approach offers a sustainable solution for global surveillance networks, providing actionable insights for policymakers to strengthen global health security and improve preparedness for future pandemics.

### Description:

Readme files are available in each subfolder to guide the workflow. The project is organized into the following subfolders:
- [data](data/): the raw data used in the project. Note that some data are not publicly available and readers should refer to their original source for access.
- [scripts](scripts/): the scripts used for data processing, model building, model fitting, and model simulation.
- [results](results/): the results generated from the analysis.
